# react-comics

## Intro
This is an application where users can add to a continuously growing database of comic books. Users will be able to 'favorite' their favorite authors, characters, illustrators, and publishers. These 'favorites' guide the user to other comics they may be interested in. Never miss an issue featuring your favorite character again! 
Admins have the ability to delete and edit entries making this a great app for comic book shops!
